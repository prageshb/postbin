      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Welcome to our platform, a versatile sharing space where you can post 
        anything you want! Unlike traditional text-only sites like Pastebin, 
        we encourage creativity and self-expression by allowing users to share 
        not just text, but also images and other media.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-gray-800">What You Can Post</h2>
      <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4 text-gray-700">
        <li>Text snippets and notes</li>
        <li>Images and GIFs</li>
        <li>Links to videos or other resources</li>
        <li>Creative content like memes and art</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        Our goal is to create a community where people can share their ideas, 
        artworks, and thoughts freely. Whether you want to share a quick message, 
        a funny image, or a thought-provoking piece of content, you can do so 
        without needing an account or going through a lengthy authorization process.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-gray-800">Moderation</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        While our site promotes freedom of expression, we have implemented minor 
        moderation to ensure that the content shared adheres to basic community 
        guidelines. This helps maintain a respectful and safe environment for 
        all users. We encourage users to report any inappropriate content they 
        come across.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-4 text-gray-800">Get Involved</h2>
      <p className="mb-4 text-gray-700">
        We invite you to join our community and start posting! Your contributions 
        help make our platform vibrant and diverse. Let your creativity flow and 
        share whatever you want with the world!
